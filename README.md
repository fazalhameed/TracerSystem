## Tracer System Implementation

## Objective

Designing an embedded/IoT product for real-time tracking using components like ESP32, STM8, UBLOX NEO-6M V2 GPS Module, and LoRaWAN module.

## Components Used
- ESP32 microcontrollers
- STM8 microcontroller
- UBLOX NEO-6M V2 GPS Module
- LoRaWAN module

## Abstraction
The Tracer device utilizes ESP32 microcontroller and UBLOX NEO-6M V2 GPS Module for real-time tracking. Communication between GPS and ESP32 is achieved via UART protocol. GPS coordinates can be converted into a map location using mapping APIs like Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or Mapbox.

## Communication without Internet
For communication without internet, consider Bluetooth or LoRa. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) connects to nearby devices, while LoRa enables long-range communication without internet dependency.

Network Connection Options
1. **Local Wi-Fi Network:** Connect ESP32 to a local Wi-Fi network for communication.
2. **Ad-Hoc Wi-Fi Network:** Create a direct Wi-Fi connection between devices.
3. **Offline Map Data:** Pre-load map data onto devices for offline map viewing.

## Range Limit of Offline Map Data
There's no inherent range limit, but it depends on device storage capacity, map resolution, compression, and updates.

## Mapbox and LoRaWAN
Mapbox offers mapping tools, while LoRaWAN facilitates long-range IoT communication. They can be used together for real-time tracking and visualization.

## Methodologies
Utilize ESP-IDF platform-io in VSCODE for development. Security configurations include WPA3, PMF for Wi-Fi.

## Monitoring Unit
Installed in remote areas for real-time monitoring and vehicle control, Wi-Fi configured for data transfer to web/mobile apps.

## Moving Unit
Installed in vehicles to transmit encrypted sensor data to the monitoring unit for processing.

## Map JavaScript APIs
Refer to Google Maps JavaScript API documentation for map integration.

## Implementation
